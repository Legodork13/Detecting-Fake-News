# Detecting-Fake-News
In this task, I used the sklearn library to build a classical machine learning model that can determine with high accuracy of over 90% whether the news is real (REAL) or fake (FAKE).

Successfully applied fidfVectorizer to extract features from text data and PassiveAggressiveClassifier.
